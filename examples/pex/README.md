# PEX example

This folder shows examples of how to use the [run-pex-as-data-source](https://github.com/terraform-modules-krish/terraform-aws-utilities/blob/v0.1.8/modules/run-pex-as-data-source) and
[run-pex-as-resource](https://github.com/terraform-modules-krish/terraform-aws-utilities/blob/v0.1.8/modules/run-pex-as-resource) modules to run python scripts wrapped with a PEX environment.

These modules use the [prepare-pex-environment module](https://github.com/terraform-modules-krish/terraform-aws-utilities/blob/v0.1.8/modules/prepare-pex-environment) under the hood to prepare the
runtime environment for unpacking and running PEX binaries. You can learn more about PEX in [the module
documentation](https://github.com/terraform-modules-krish/terraform-aws-utilities/blob/v0.1.8/modules/prepare-pex-environment/README.md).


## The python script

This example will run the python script using the PEX environment provided in the [sample-python-script
folder](./sample-python-script). The PEX environment contains a virtualenv with all the requirements specified in
[requirements.txt](./sample-python-script/requirements.txt) installed. The PEX environment only includes the virtualenv
and does not include the script. If you run it directly, you will be dropped into a python shell with the PATH set such
that you can import the requirements. If you would like to run the script directly, you must call it from the PEX:

```bash
python ./sample-python-script/bin/sample_python_script_py27_env.pex ./sample-python-script/sample_python_script/main.py
```

Note that the PEX is versioned by python version (py27 or py3). The py27 PEX only works with python 2.7, while the py3
PEX will work with python versions 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7.

### Building the PEX

The PEX file is created using the `pex` utility. However, since it is versioned to be compatible with multiple versions
of python, you must have each version of python installed. It is recommended to use
[`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to help setup an environment with multiple python interpreters.

For convenience, a build script with a local pyenv version (a `.python-version` file) is provided. To use the build
script, first install all necessary versions of python with pyenv:

```bash
pyenv install 2.7.12
pyenv install 3.5.2
pyenv install 3.6.6
pyenv install 3.7.0
```

Once the python versions are installed, change your working directory to the `build_scripts` directory:

```bash
# From the repo root
cd ./examples/pex/sample-python-script/build_scripts
```

Finally, run the build script:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This will build the PEX binary files for each python version and put it in the `bin` directory.

**NOTE**: Although the build script only supports Unix environments, the PEX that it creates is compatible with Windows
environments.


## How do you run these examples?

1. Ensure python is installed in your OS.
1. Install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).
1. `terraform init`.
1. `terraform apply`.
