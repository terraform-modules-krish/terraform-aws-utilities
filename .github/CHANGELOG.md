## Description

<!-- A description of the changes made in this release. Be sure to update any TODOs. -->

- Updated the CircleCI config (internal to this repo only).
- **Unlocked AWS provider v4. Require minimum 3.75.1.** This update includes a few upgrade tests that make sure upgrading to this module from the last release is easy. However, you may need to bump your AWS provider version. See the migration guide notes below for more.

### Migration Guide

The AWS Provider v4 unlock is a functionally backward compatible update. Modules no longer have the AWS Provider v4 lock. Upgrade tests were run to give reasonable confidence that upgrading to this version of the modules from the last tagged release is backward compatible, requiring no further modifications from you. However, the AWS Provider version must be `3.75.1` or newer, so you may need to run `terraform init` with the `-upgrade` flag, which will allow terraform to pull the latest version of the AWS provider, as in `terraform init -upgrade`.

## Description

<!-- A description of the changes made in this release. Be sure to update any TODOs. -->

Support for python2 has been dropped. All modules that depend on python now require python 3, and calls out to `python3` directly. Most users should not be impacted by this change, as almost all operating systems ship with `python3` now.

## Migration guide

If you are on a system where `python3` is not available and you were relying on `python`, you will now need to install `python3`.

## Description
**Terraform 1.1 upgrade**: We have verified that this repo is compatible with Terraform `1.1.x`! 
  - From this release onward, we will only be running tests with Terraform `1.1.x` against this repo, so we recommend updating to `1.1.x` soon! 
  - We have also updated the minimum required version of Terraform to `1.0.0`. While our repos might continue to be compatible with pre-1.0.0 version of Terraform, we are no longer making any guarantees of that.
  - Once all Gruntwork repos have been upgraded to work with `1.1.x`, we will publish a migration guide with a version compatibility table and announce it all via the Gruntwork Newsletter.

- **Terraform 0.14 upgrade**: We have verified that this repo is compatible with Terraform `0.14.x`! 
    - From this release onward, we will only be running tests with Terraform `0.14.x` against this repo, so we recommend updating to `0.14.x` soon! 
    - To give you more time to upgrade, for the time being, all modules will still support Terraform `0.12.26` and above, as that version has several features in it (`required_providers` with `source` URLs) that make it more forwards compatible with `0.14.x`. 
    - Once all Gruntwork repos have been upgrade to work with `0.14.x`, we will publish a migration guide with a version compatibility table and announce it all via the Gruntwork Newsletter.
- Remove docker key from machine config
- Add placeholder.tf for TFC/TFE/PMR
- Lock PIP's version to be smaller than 21.0

## Description

<!-- A description of the changes made in this release. Be sure to update any TODOs. -->

- **Terraform 0.13 upgrade**: We have verified that this repo is compatible with Terraform `0.13.x`! 
    - From this release onward, we will only be running tests with Terraform `0.13.x` against this repo, so we recommend updating to `0.13.x` soon! 
    - To give you more time to upgrade, for the time being, all modules will still support Terraform 0.12.26 and above, as that version has several features in it (`required_providers` with `source` URLs) that make it more forwards compatible with `0.13.x`. 
   - Once all Gruntwork repos have been upgrade to work with `0.13.x`, we will publish a migration guide with a version compatibility table and announce it all via the Gruntwork Newsletter.
- The `run-pex-as-resource` module no longer supports running code on `destroy`. See the migration guide below for more details.


## Migration guide

- The `run-pex-as-resource` module will no longer run your executable on `destroy`. We had to drop this (rarely used) functionality due to a [backwards-incompatible change in Terraform 0.13 to destroy-time provisioners](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-13.html#destroy-time-provisioners-may-not-refer-to-other-resources).
- If you were depending on this behavior, you will need to find an alternative, such as creating a custom Terraform provider.
- You can no longer pass the following input params to the `run-pex-as-resource` module:
    - `destroy_command_args`
    - `enable_destroy_provisioner`

# v0.1.0
_Released Jun 6, 2019_
## Modules

- `intermediate-variable` [**REMOVED**]
- `list-remove` [**BREAKING**]
- `join-path` [**BREAKING**]
- `operating-system` [**BREAKING**]
- `prepare-pex-environment` [**BREAKING**]
- `require-executable` [**BREAKING**]
- `run-pex-as-data-source` [**BREAKING**]
- `run-pex-as-resource` [**BREAKING**]

## Description

**All the modules are now terraform 0.12.0 compatible**. Note that this means the modules are **no longer compatible with terraform 0.11 and under**. Starting this release, you must use terraform 0.12.0 or greater to use this module.

All the module variables have been updated to use concrete types based on the new type system introduced in terraform 0.12.0. You can learn more about the types in [the official documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/types.html).

Note that as part of this, we switched to using `null` to indicate unset values when passing them through to resources. If you were previously using a 0 value (`""` for strings and `0` for numbers), review the module `variables.tf` file to double check if the 0 value has been converted to a `null`.

Additionally, we have deprecated and removed the `intermediate-variable` module in this release. This module has been superseded by [terraform local values](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/locals.html). To upgrade, switch usage of `intermediate-variable` with `locals`.

# v0.0.6
_Released Jan 9, 2019_
## Modules affected

- **[NEW]** `run-pex-as-data-source`
- **[NEW]** `run-pex-as-resource`

## Description

This release introduces modules that support running python PEX files in Terraform in a way such that the scripts themselves do not need to be embedded in the pex. See [the documentation](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-terraform-utilities/blob/master/modules/prepare-pex-environment/README.md#what-is-pex) to learn more about pex.

- `run-pex-as-data-source` can be used to run python pex files as an external data source.
- `run-pex-as-resource` can be used to run python pex files as a local-exec provisioner on a null_resource.

<br>

# v0.0.2
_Released Mar 1, 2018_
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-terraform-utilities/pull/3: Added two new modules:

1. `operating-system`: This can be used to detect the operating system on which Terraform is currently running.

1. `join-path`: This can be used to join multiple path parts (folders, files) into a single path, using the proper separator for the current OS.

The primary use case is so we can format paths properly on Windows vs Linux.

# v0.0.1
_Released Mar 7, 2017_
https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-terraform-utilities/pull/1: First release! We've created an intermediate-variable module.
