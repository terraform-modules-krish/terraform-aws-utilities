# Python pex scripts fail on windows machines without long path support

**yorinasub17** commented *Apr 8, 2020*

Python 3 has native long path support built in on windows, but it only supports Windows 10 and requires [enabling certain settings](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#removing-the-max-path-limitation) that may not be accessible to end users.

The failure mode is that the pex zip file fails to unzip into the `$HOME/.pex/install` directory. This probably requires a fix within pex itself.
