# Missing `aws` provider explicitly specified for this repo

**ina-stoyanova** commented *Feb 19, 2021*

While updating to `tf14`, we found that the upgrade script did not add any `required_providers` block. We then realised it's because there were no `provider` blocks in the original code. 

It might be best to add a specific version provider for `aws` instead of relying on the default one, when not specified.
