It looks like 'Terraform Cloud/dev0P5/terraform-aws-utilities' failed. Is this a concern? I'm not able to see why it failed.

It's unrelated. There's a few repos where this is happening, other folks have added a Terraform Cloud hook to our repos. We don't have any way of knowing who it is (or what org dev0P5 is).
