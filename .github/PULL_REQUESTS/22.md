# Destroy provisioner

**yorinasub17** commented *Dec 19, 2019*

This PR introduces the ability to setup a destroy provisioner for the `run-pex-as-resource` module, so that you can run the same pex in cleanup mode on destroy.

Between the unit tests, circleci build, and the integration test in `aws-securityhub` (https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cis-compliance-aws/pull/24), I am fairly confident in this feature so will go ahead and merge.

With that said, feedback is still welcome and will address any issues in a subsequent PR.
