# Fix pexbug

**yorinasub17** commented *Jun 13, 2019*

There was a type change in the tf12 upgrade that broke the pex utilities. The upgrade tool converted the string `"2"` to the number `2` in the python version comparison, which caused the utility to never resolve py2 and thus always pick the py3 pex. This worked in the unit tests because the packages used in the unit test (`click` and `six`) ship wheels that are py2 and py3 compatible, so it didn't matter which pex it used.

I added a regression test that adds the `jsonschema` library to the pex, which does depend on the py version. This test [fails without the fix](https://circleci.com/gh/gruntwork-io/package-terraform-utilities/84), which subsequently [passes once the fix is introduced](https://circleci.com/gh/gruntwork-io/package-terraform-utilities/85).

Given the confirmation via the regression test, going to merge and release this right away.
