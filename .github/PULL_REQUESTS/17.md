# Tf12 Upgrade

**yorinasub17** commented *May 29, 2019*

This updates all the modules to be tf12 compatible. Additionally, implements the following enhancements:

- Remove `intermediate-variable`, as it is superseded by `locals` and customers should upgrade to using that as part of upgrading to tf12.
- Add badges: The latest version released + TF version indicator.

> type on all input vars and null for default.

Updated all the input vars to have concrete types. However, I couldn't use `null` as the default where I use `""`, because `null` can't be interpolated into a template. Since the vars are interpolated into the python script, that restriction breaks things.

Ok addressed the comment, so going to merge and release this. Our first tf12 module!
