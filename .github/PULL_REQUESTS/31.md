I'll get back to this. I thought this would be an easy transition (since I've done so many of them), but it looks like there's something about the circleci docker image that is different than the machine image that is preventing go modules from working correctly.

I'm probably going to switch this to use the image from https://github.com/gruntwork-io/circle-ci-docker-images
