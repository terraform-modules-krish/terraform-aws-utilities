# Support triggers and environment variables for pex null_resource

**yorinasub17** commented *Sep 10, 2019*

This adds support for the `triggers` attribute on the `null_resource` provisioned using `run-pex-as-resource`.

Additionally, this adds support for setting environment variables for the null resource provisioner command.
