In the process, fix the build.

To fix this, what repo(s) did you use as an example to start from?

I see that the build is running a couple more times now, but I saw the passing build, so I'm going to approve this.

I used `terraform-aws-eks`, but then bumped a few versions (e.g., the machine image and python docker image).

Ah the latest build failed due to concurrency issue with request quota increase, but I also see a bug where `resource_class: small` is not valid for machine executors. I updated this to `medium`!
