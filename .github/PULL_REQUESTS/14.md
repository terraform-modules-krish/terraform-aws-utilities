# Add list-remove module

**yorinasub17** commented *Apr 18, 2019*

This implements a `list-remove` module, which can be used to do list subtraction. In other words, this is a module to be able to remove specific items from a list in terraform.

Note: This was inspired from a conversation with a customer in slack.

UPDATE 8798f61 :

- Added more test cases
- Added note that this will not work if you need duplicate items in the input list.

Will merge and cut release if the build passes.
