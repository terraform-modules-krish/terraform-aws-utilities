# PEX support

**yorinasub17** commented *Jan 7, 2019*

This modularizes the PEX pattern in `module-ecs` and `package-k8s`. Specifically, this extracts out the entrypoint scripts that wrap the pex binary, which includes the logic for:

- Figuring out which pex to use based on python version
- Munging the `PYTHONPATH` to include the module library so that we don't need to define everything in one python file.
- Updating the `PYTHONPATH` for the pex and the module so that it works with Windows path size requirement.

Bonus stuff included here:
- Upgrading `terratest`
- Installing `terratest_log_parser` to circle ci build
- Including `join-path` and `operating-system` in the root README.

Found a bug with windows in the terraform inline string interpolation (in this block [here](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-terraform-utilities/pull/6/files#diff-d7d2c6d73eb3090cf380c944a14599d7R20)), where the path character being `\` poses problems when the hash starts with 0 (because it becomes `\0` and that is the null character :( ).

Closing for now, and will reopen when I fix it. In the meantime, I am going to do PR surgery to extract out the pieces around terratest upgrade and README updates in a different PR.
