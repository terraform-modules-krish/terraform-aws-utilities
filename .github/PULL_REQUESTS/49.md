# Update modules to Terraform 1.0.x

**yorinasub17** commented *Jul 22, 2021*

- **Terraform 1.0 upgrade**: We have verified that this repo is compatible with Terraform `1.0.x`! 
    - From this release onward, we will only be running tests with Terraform `1.0.x` against this repo, so we recommend updating to `1.0.x` soon! 
    - To give you more time to upgrade, for the time being, all modules will still support Terraform `0.12.26` and above, as that version has several features in it (`required_providers` with `source` URLs) that make it more forwards compatible with `1.0.x`. 
    - Once all Gruntwork repos have been upgrade to work with `1.0.x`, we will publish a migration guide with a version compatibility table and announce it all via the Gruntwork Newsletter.
