# Require executable

**yorinasub17** commented *Jan 8, 2019*

I couldn't find anything in terraform that provides this, so decided to implement it here. This module essentially checks if the provided executable exists in the PATH, and if not, fails the apply and emits an error message. Even though this is trivial to implement, the goal of this module was to make it easy to provide a custom error message when the executable doesn't exist in a platform independent manner.
