# Fix race condition

Of course, as soon as I merge https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-terraform-utilities/pull/10 the build breaks: https://circleci.com/gh/gruntwork-io/package-terraform-utilities/56

Luckily, I knew right away what was wrong: race condition on trying to share the same terraform code for different tests.
