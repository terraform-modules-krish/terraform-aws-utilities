# Fix to use python3 instead of python

**yorinasub17** commented *May 6, 2022*

Now that MacOS is no longer shipping `python`, using `python` to call Python is causing a lot of problems. This PR updates these modules to use `python3` to call python instead.

Note that this also deprecates and remove support for python2 in the pex system. We can deprecate and remove the pex system entirely when we tackle https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-ecs/issues/294
