# Add VPC and IAM resources to request_quota_increase + code gen script

**marinalimeira** commented *Feb 12, 2021*

**THIS PR IS BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE** the existing keys, `nat_gateway` and `nacl_rules`, were changed.

This is an improvement of #38.

Changes:
- New script to generate code to generate the necessary code to add a new resource
- No need to use the 'Service Code' to lookup for resources, using [aws_servicequotas_service_quota](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/data-sources/servicequotas_service_quota).
- `nat_gateway` renamed to `vpc_nat_gateways_per_availability_zone` to follow new pattern
- `nacl_rules` renamed to `vpc_rules_per_network_acl` to follow new pattern

@marinalimeira This is an old PR, but I like the changes. Can we fix the conflicts, merge this up and take care of NITs later?

It is still failing but it works locally for me... I will investigate this on Monday.

**marinalimeira** commented *Aug 16, 2022*

Sooooo... I finally took the proper time to take a look at this. I was running the tests in the wrong branch, that's why it was working locally...

Well, there was a tiny typo in the test, it's fixed now! cb40b56 Tests will hopefully pass in this run and we can merge it!

@rhoboat can you take a final look? :)
