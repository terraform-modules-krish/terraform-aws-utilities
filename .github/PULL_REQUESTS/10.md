# require-executable should ignore empty list

**yorinasub17** commented *Jan 8, 2019*

I just realized that the `require-executable` module that was just shipped doesn't support empty list or empty strings, which makes it hard to implement a conditional check.

This fixes that. See the new example for how to (awkwardly) do a conditional check, and the docs on why this way.
