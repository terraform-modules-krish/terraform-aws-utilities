# Introduce enabled-aws-regions module that can be used to get the list of available regions

**yorinasub17** commented *Dec 5, 2019*

For modules like AWS Config and GuardDuty where we want to enable it on all AWS Regions, we need someway to get the list of enabled regions in Terraform. There is no native data source right now that provides this information. This PR introduces a new module that can be used to work around this limitation by using a python script to query the AWS API for the list of enabled regions on an account.
