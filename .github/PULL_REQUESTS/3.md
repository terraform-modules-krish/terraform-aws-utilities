# Add operating-system and join-path modules

**brikis98** commented *Mar 1, 2018*

This PR adds two modules:

1. `operating-system`: This can be used to detect the operating system on which Terraform is currently running.

1. `join-path`: This can be used to join multiple path parts (folders, files) into a single path, using the proper separator for the current OS.

The primary use case is so we can format paths properly on Windows vs Linux, such as in the [server-group module](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-asg/blob/master/modules/server-group/main.tf#L448), where the path to our Python script is currently broken on Windows.

Note that we don't currently have a good way to actually test this on Windows :(
