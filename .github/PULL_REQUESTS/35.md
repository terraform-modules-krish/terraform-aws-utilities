This is the first time I do this, so not sure if I missed something!

Ohhhhhh waittttt. I just realized I had attempted this earlier, and failed to get the tests to pass: https://github.com/gruntwork-io/package-terraform-utilities/pull/31

I think there is a problem with the circleci docker image and go modules.

@yorinasub17 I am doing exactly the same thing you did before :D

There's actually one significant difference you are attempting here, which is that you are running it on the machine image as opposed to docker, so I think this has a good chance of succeeding :)

I started this because the Terratest version is too old and it was missing some features and it looks like it wasn't as simple as I thought

Hope it works! 🤞

Made a rebase since I had many 1-line commits to test the CircleCI build.
