# Implement intermediate-variable module

**brikis98** commented *Mar 7, 2017*

This PR adds a simple module that returns as output the exact variables you pass to it as inputs. This gives you a way to store intermediate values that contain interpolations.

I needed to use this module in several places in `usage-patterns` and it doesn’t seem to fit in any existing place. I’ve created similar “utility” modules like this in the past and always shoved them into random places. I figure this repo can be a home for this sort of code in the future. We could probably open source this module...

@josh-padnick Check out this new repo & module. The code is trivial, so I'm going to merge so I can use it ASAP for usage-patterns. Feedback welcome.
