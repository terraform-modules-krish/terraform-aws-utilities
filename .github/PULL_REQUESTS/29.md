# Add instance-type module to help deal with t2.micro / t3.micro issue

**brikis98** commented *Jul 17, 2020*

This PR adds a new `instance-type` module to help us solve the issue where `t2.micro` and `t3.micro` instances are each available in some AZs, but not available in others. This module takes in a list of instance types to pick from and returns the recommended one to use, which is one that's available in all AZs in the current region.
